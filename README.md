COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, a new coronavirus discovered in 2019. Many of the pre-existing conditions that increase the risk of hospitalization in those with COVID-19 are the same diseases that are affected by long-term exposure to air pollution.

Investigate whether long-term average exposure to low air quality environments is associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 hospitalization in the United States.
